If you are interested in playing as the French Army in Arma 3, you will need to install some mods that will give you access to their equipment, uniforms, and vehicles. There are several mods that can help you achieve this, but here are some of the most popular and recommended ones:
 
- [French Army Collection / Collection pour l'armÃ©e franÃ§aise](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1625671944): This mod is a collection of other mods and addons that provide a variety of assets for the French Army, such as weapons, helicopters, planes, vehicles, and uniforms. It also includes some mods that are not available on the Steam Workshop, such as the Cougar, Tiger, Lynx, and NH90 helicopters, and the AC-130 plane.
- [French Armed Forces](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1941037416): This mod is a standalone version of the previous mod, which means it does not require any other mods or dependencies. It adds a French retexture of vanilla vehicles, units, and objects. It also includes some custom models, such as the Titus armored vehicle, the Fregate ship, and various uniforms.
- [AMF\_AIO](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1781990846): This mod is a work in progress project by ArmaModFrance, a team of talented 3D artists and modders who aim to reproduce the French Army in Arma 3.
